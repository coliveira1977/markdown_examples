***Markdown output 🛫***

CKEditor 5 can be configured to output Markdown instead of HTML. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting to plain text documents. Use the Source button to check and edit the Markdown source code of this content.

The editor-produced Markdown output supports most essential features, like links, different kinds of emphasis, inline code formatting, or code blocks:

    p {
        text-align: center;
        color: red;
    }

***Markdown input 🛬***

Thanks to the autoformatting feature, you can use Markdown syntax when writing. Try it out - use these (or any other) Markdown shortcuts in the editor to format the content on the fly 🚀!

Inline formatting

***Shortcut***

    Bold

    Type ** or __ around your text.

***Italic***

    Type * or _ around your text.

***Code***

    Type ˋ around your text.

***Strikethrough***

    Type ~~ around your text.

Shh! 🤫 Markdown has very basic support for tables. Some advanced table-related features like table or cell styling were disabled in this demo.

| Inline formatting | Shortcut |
| --- | --- |
| **Bold** | Type `**` or `__` around your text. |
| _Italic_ | Type `*` or `_` around your text. |
| `Code` | Type `ˋ` around your text. |
| ~Strikethrough~ | Type `~~` around your text. |

## Block formatting

You can also use Markdown to create various text blocks, such as:

*   Block quotes - Start a line with `﹥` followed by a space.
*   Headings:
    1.  Heading 1 - Start a line with `#` followed by a space.
    2.  Heading 2 - Start a line with `##` followed by a space.
    3.  Heading 3 - Start a line with `###` followed by a space.
