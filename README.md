Markdown output ðŸ›«

CKEditor 5 can be configured to output Markdown instead of HTML. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting to plain text documents. Use the Source button to check and edit the Markdown source code of this content.

The editor-produced Markdown output supports most essential features, like links, different kinds of emphasis, inline code formatting, or code blocks:

    p {
        text-align: center;
        color: red;
    }
